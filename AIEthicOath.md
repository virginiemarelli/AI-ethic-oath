I swear to fulfill, to the best of my ability and judgment, this covenant: 

I will respect the hard-won scientific gains of those technology practitioners in whose steps I walk and gladly share such knowledge as is mine with those who are to follow. 

I will apply my arts for the benefit of all, regardless of race, religion, age, nationality and social standing. I will abstain from causing harm or injury 

While I continue to enhance my knowledge and learning, I will not be ashamed to say ‘I know not’, nor will I fail to call in my colleagues when the skills of another are needed to make a system ethical, responsible and sustainable. 

I will respect users' privacy and consent, for their data is not entrusted to me to be shared or exploited. Most especially I tread with care in developing technology. If it is given to me to improve human life and contribute to societal progress, all thanks. But it may also be within my power to harm society, this awesome responsibility must be faced with great humbleness and awareness of my own frailty. Above all, I must not play God. 

I will remember that I do not only create code, models and business decisions, but I have an impact on society and people. My technology might affect the user’s family and economic stability. I will not permit considerations of business profit, societal pressure, or personal bias to compromise the fundamental rights, dignity, and privacy of users. I will apply my capabilities for the welfare of all humanity, free from bias or discrimination, to the best of my ability and judgment

I will remember that I remain a member of society, with special obligations to all my fellow human beings.

If I do not violate this oath, may I enjoy life and art, respected while I live and remembered with affection afterwards. May I always act so as to preserve the finest traditions of my calling and may I long experience the joy of developing technology.
